# Efficient-Page-Replacement-Algorithm-Simulator-
Design a simulator that allows users to test and compare different page replacement algorithms (e.g., FIFO, LRU, Optimal). The simulator should provide visualizations and performance metrics to aid in understanding algorithm efficiency ..

Overview

This project is a Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator that allows users to visualize and compare different page replacement algorithms: FIFO (First-In-First-Out), LRU (Least Recently Used), and Optimal Algorithm. The simulator takes a page reference string and the number of frames as input and provides step-by-step results with the number of page faults and page hits.

Features

Supports FIFO, LRU, and Optimal page replacement algorithms.

Interactive UI with an input field for a page reference string and frame count.

Displays step-by-step execution for each algorithm.

Shows total page faults and page hits.

Simple and user-friendly design with smooth animations.

Technologies Used

HTML – Structure of the simulator.

CSS – Styling and animations.

JavaScript – Logic for simulating page replacement algorithms.

Example Input & Output

Input:

Page Reference String: 7 0 1 2 0 3 4 2 3 0 3

Number of Frames: 3

Algorithm: FIFO

Output:

Step-by-step frame updates

Total Page Faults: X

Total Page Hits: Y
